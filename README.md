# ArtisticVideo
###It's a plugin that allows you to play videos in your pocketmine server,
###based on transferred texts,you can also edit the block for each string.

#####Use CharPlayer(I only share this file) to transfer the videos into texts
#####(CharPlayer is written in Chinese..someway)(PHP7 is more suggested.)

#####Download CharPlayer&The Example TXT(Bad Apple):http://zxda.mudegg.net/CharPlayer&ExampleTXT.zip
#####Put the "badapple.txt to /Art/ArtisticText/GetFiles" and write the config file like this:
  x: 200<br>
  "y": 4<br>
  z: 200<br>
  world: world<br>
  text: badapple.txt<br>
  Height: 61<br>
  blocks:<br>
    ' ': 155<br>
